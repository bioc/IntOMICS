## Summary

Multi-omics data from the same set of samples contain complementary
information and may provide a more accurate and holistic view of the biological
system consisting of different interconnected molecular components.
Hence, a computational framework to infer regulatory relationships 
by integrating multiple modalities is one of the most relevant and challenging 
problems in systems biology.

IntOMICS is an efficient integrative framework based on Bayesian networks.
IntOMICS systematically analyses gene expression (GE), DNA methylation (METH),
copy number variation (CNV) and biological prior knowledge (B) to infer
regulatory networks. IntOMICS complements the missing biological prior knowledge
by so-called empirical biological knowledge (empB), estimated from the available  
experimental data.

An automatically tuned MCMC algorithm (Yang and Rosenthal, 2017) estimates model
parameters and the empirical biological knowledge. Conventional MCMC algorithm
with additional Markov blanket resampling (MBR) step (Su and Borsuk, 2016)
infers resulting regulatory network structure consisting of three
types of nodes: GE nodes refer to gene expression levels, CNV nodes refer
to associated copy number variations, and METH nodes refer to associated
DNA methylation probe(s). Regulatory networks derived from IntOMICS provide
deeper insights into the complex flow of genetic information. IntOMICS is 
a powerful resource for exploratory systems biology and can provide valuable
insights into the complex mechanisms of biological processes that has a vital
role in personalised medicine.


IntOMICS takes as input `MatchedAssayExperiment` or named `list` with:

1. gene expression matrix,  
2. associated copy number variation matrix sampled from the same individuals 
(optional),  
3. associated DNA methylation matrix of beta-values sampled from the same
individuals (optional), and  
4. the biological prior knowledge with information on known interactions
among molecular features (optional; highly recommended).   

The resulting regulatory network structure contains the edge weights $w_i$
representing the empirical frequency of given edge over samples of network
structures from two independent MCMC simulations.

For further details about the IntOMICS algorithm, its performance and benchmark
analysis, see manuscript Pacinkova \& Popovici, 2022.


Projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas aim to catalogue 
multi-omics data from a large number of samples.
IntOMICS framework is demonstrated using colon cancer data from the
`r Biocpkg("curatedTCGA")` package. However, it is not limited to any particular
omics data or phenotype.

## Installation

```{r include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# bioconductor install
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("IntOMICS")

# install the newest (development) version from GitHub

remotes::install_github("anna-pacinkova/IntOMICS")  

```

## Usage

This tutorial will show you how to use the `r Biocpkg("IntOMICS")` package   
with a toy example. The example dataset consisting of processed gene expression,
DNA methylation (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) and copy number
variation is from the TCGA data portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/): primary
colon cancer samples (COAD) with microsatellite instability (MSI). However,   
the approach is not limited to any phenotype. We choose the set of 8 genes
from the KEGG Colorectal cancer pathway(https://www.genome.jp/pathway/hsa05210).

### Part 1: Input data

IntOMICS framework takes as input:  
  
1. gene expression matrix $GE$ ($m$ x $n_1$) with microarray intensities or 
RNA-seq count data transformed into a continuous domain ($m$ samples and $n_1$ 
features)
  
2. associated copy number variation matrix $CNV$ ($m$ x $n_2$) with continuous
segment mean values derived for each gene ($n_2 \leq n_1$),
  
3. associated DNA methylation matrix of beta-values $METH$ ($m$ x $n_3$),
  
4. data.frame including all known interactions between molecular features 
(information from public available databases such as KEGG (Ogata et al., 1999) 
or REACTOME (Wu \& Haw, 2017)). Any other source of prior knowledge can be used. 
(IntOMICS is designed to run even if prior knowledge is not available. However, 
we highly recommend to use it.)

5. logical matrix with known transcription factors (TFs) and its targets 
(information from public available databases such as ENCODE (ENCODE Project 
Consortium, 2004). Any other source can be used. (IntOMICS is designed to run 
even if any TF-target interaction is not available.)
  
All data matrices are sampled from the same individuals.  


We use `r Biocpkg("curatedTCGA")` package to obtain publicly available toy 
dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):
```{r echo=TRUE, include=FALSE}

coad_SE <- curatedTCGAData("COAD",
                           c("RNASeq2GeneNorm_illuminahiseq",
                             "Methylation_methyl450","GISTIC_AllByGene"), 
                           version = "2.0.1", dry.run = FALSE)
coad_SE <- TCGAprimaryTumors(coad_SE)
 
coad_ma <- MatchedAssayExperiment(coad_SE)
## keep NA for Methylation data
coad_ma <- subsetByColData(coad_ma, coad_ma$MSI_status == "MSI-H" | 
                             is.na(coad_ma$MSI_status))
# choose first 50 samples for illustration
coad_ma <- subsetByColData(coad_ma, c(rep(TRUE,50),
                                      rep(FALSE,ncol(coad_ma[[1]])-50)))
rownames(coad_ma[["COAD_GISTIC_AllByGene-20160128"]]) <- rowData(coad_ma[["COAD_GISTIC_AllByGene-20160128"]])[["Gene.Symbol"]]
 
data(list=c("gene_annot","annot"))
rowselect <- list(gene_annot$gene_symbol, gene_annot$gene_symbol, 
                  unlist(annot))
names(rowselect) <- names(coad_ma)
omics <- coad_ma[rowselect, , ]
names(omics) <- c("cnv","ge","meth")

```

Available omics data are saved in a MatchedAssayExperiment object including 
gene expression (GE) of 8 genes + copy number variation (CNV) of 8 genes + beta 
value of 9 DNA methylation (METH) probes:

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

t(assay(omics[["ge"]]))[1:5,1:5]

```
These values correspond to normalised RNA-seq data (in this case transcripts 
per million (TPM)). 
However, the user is not limited to this platform. Another assay, 
such as microarray data, can be used.


```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

t(assay(omics[["cnv"]]))[1:5,1:5]

```
These copy number values represent segment mean values equal 
to $log_2(\frac{copy-number}{2})$.
In the `omics$cnv` matrix, define only columns with available CNV data.


```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

t(assay(omics[["meth"]]))[1:5,1:5]

```
These values represent DNA methylation beta values of given probes 
(defined by IDs).  

IntOMICS is designed to infer regulatory networks even if the copy number 
variation or DNA methylation data (or both) are not available. In such a case, 
omics must be a MatchedAssayExperiment with gene expression. 

If methylation data are available, we have to provide an annotation:
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

str(annot)

```
`annot` is a named list. Each component of the list is a character vector and 
corresponds to probe IDs associated with a given gene. 

We also have to provide a gene annotation table:
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

gene_annot

```
`gene_annot` is Gene ID conversion table with "entrezID" and "gene_symbol" 
column names. Entrez IDs are used in for regulatory network inference, gene 
symbols are used for the final regulatory network visualisation.    

And finally, the prior knowledge from any source chosen by the user:
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

data("PK")
PK

```
`PK` is the data.frame with biological prior knowledge about known interactions 
between features. Column names are "src_entrez" (the parent node), "dest_entrez" 
(the child node) and "edge_type" (the prior knowledge about the direct 
interaction between parent and child node; the allowed values are "present" or 
"missing").

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

data("TFtarg_mat")
TFtarg_mat[1:5,1:5]

```
`TFtarg_mat` is a logical matrix with known transcription factors (TFs) and its 
targets. TFs are listed in columns, corresponding targets are listed in rows.


```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

data("layers_def")
layers_def

```
`layers_def` is a data.frame containing:

1) the modality ID (character vector);
must be same as names of `omics` MatchedAssayExperiment object,

2) corresponding layer in IntOMICS MCMC scheme (numeric vector);
edges from the lowest layer (must be always GE) to the CNV/METH layers are
excluded from the set of candidate edges), and

3) maximal number of parents from given layer to GE nodes (numeric vector).

### Part 2: Data preprocessing

The first step is to define the biological prior matrix and estimate the upper
bound of the partition function needed to define the prior distribution of
network structures.
We also need to define all possible parent set configurations for each node.
For each parent set configuration, we compute the energy (needed to define
the prior distribution of network structures) and the BGe score (needed
to determine the posterior probability of network structures).
These functionalities are available through the `OMICS_module` function.
We can use linear regression to filter irrelevant DNA methylation probes.
In such a case, we set the parameter "lm_METH = TRUE".
We can also specify the threshold for the R^2 to choose DNA methylation probes
with significant coefficient using argument "r_squared_thres" (default = 0.3),
or p-value using "p_val_thres" (default = 0.05).
There are several other arguments: "woPKGE_belief" (default = 0.5) refers
to the belief concerning GE-GE interactions without prior knowledge,
"nonGE_belief" (default = 0.5) refers to the belief concerning the belief
concerning interactions of features except GE (e.g. CNV-GE, METH-GE),
"TFBS_belief" refers to the belief concerning the TF and its target interaction
(default = 0.75).
Note that all interactions with belief equal to "woPKGE_belief" in biological
prior knowledge will be updated in empirical biological knowledge.
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

OMICS_mod_res <- omics_module(omics = omics, 
                              PK = PK, 
                              layers_def = layers_def, 
                              TFtargs = TFtarg_mat,
                              annot = annot, 
                              gene_annot = gene_annot,
                              lm_METH = TRUE,
                              r_squared_thres = 0.3,
                              p_val_thres = 0.1)

```

This function returns several outputs:
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

names(OMICS_mod_res)

```
1. `OMICS_mod_res$pf_UB_BGe_pre` is a list that contains:
- `OMICS_mod_res$pf_UB_BGe_pre$partition_func_UB` the upper bound
of the partition function for hyperparameter $\beta = 0$,
- `OMICS_mod_res$pf_UB_BGe_pre$parents_set_combinations` all possible parent set
configuration for given node,
- `OMICS_mod_res$pf_UB_BGe_pre$energy_all_configs_node` energy for given parent
set configurations,
- `OMICS_mod_res$pf_UB_BGe_pre$BGe_score_all_configs_node` BGe score for given
parent set configurations.
2. `OMICS_mod_res$B_prior_mat` is a biological prior matrix.
3. `OMICS_mod_res$annot` contains DNA methylation probes that passed the filter.
4. `OMICS_mod_res$omics` is a list with gene expression, copy number variation
and normalised methylation data (possibly filtered if we use "lm_METH = TRUE").
5. `OMICS_mod_res$omics_meth_original` the original methylation data.



### Part 3: MCMC simulation

We use the automatically tuned MCMC algorithm (Yang and Rosenthal, 2017) 
with default setting to estimate model hyperparameter $\beta$ and empirical 
biological knowledge matrix through multiple phases.

1. The first adaptive phase is used to roughly tune the hyperparameter $\beta$, 
more precisely the variance of its proposal distribution.

2. The transient phase is applied to diagnose whether the chain has reached 
the mode of the target distribution.

3. The second adaptive phase is used to fine-tune the hyperparameter $\beta$, 
the variance of its proposal distribution and to compute the empirical 
biological prior matrix. Assuming there is no prior knowledge aboit interaction 
from node *i* to node *j*, the prior knowledge about interaction from node *i* 
to node *j* is updated during the second adaptive phase after every conventional
edge proposal move (addition, deletion, reversal).  
The empirical biological knowledge corresponds to the ratio of acceptance 
(number of iterations with accepted candidate edge from~node *i* to~node *j*) 
and frequency (number of iterations with proposed candidate edge from~node *i* 
to~node *j*). Reversing an edge is equivalent to deleting the edge and adding 
the edge in the opposite direction.

4. The empirical biological matrix and the hyperparameter $\beta$ determined 
by~the~second adaptive phase are used in the last sampling phase. 
In this phase, IntOMICS applies a *greedy horizon* approach. Three independent 
paths are executed with a fixed BGe score (except the MBR step). The most 
probable path is chosen after every 500 iterations.  
The conventional MCMC algorithm with additional Markov blanket resampling step 
(Su and Borsuk, 2016) to infer regulatory network structure consisting of three 
types of nodes: GE, CNV and METH nodes.
Two independent samples of network structures are produced to evaluate the 
convergence of the Markov chain. Each sample consists of 2*`burn_in` DAGs. 
The~resulting samples of DAGs are thinned - discarded all but every `thin` DAG.
The burn-in period and thinning frequency are arbitrary choices.
```{r echo=TRUE, include=FALSE}

if(interactive())
{
  BN_mod_res_sparse <- bn_module(burn_in = 500, 
                               thin = 50, 
                               OMICS_mod_res = OMICS_mod_res,
                               minseglen = 5)
}

```

**Because of the MCMC simulation,
`bn_module` function is time-consuming. For the illustration, we have used only 
short burn-in period of the resulting Markov chain.
We recommend to use much longer burn-in period and check trace
plots of the MCMC simulation. We recommend to use burn_in = 100.000, thin = 500,
and minseglen = 50.000 (for further details see (Pacinkova \& Popovici, 2022)).**
To investigate relevant IntOMICS outputs, use the pre-computed result
saved in `BN_mod_res` R object).  
There are two optional arguments: "len" specifies the initial width
of the sampling interval for hyperparameter $\beta$. However, this parameter
will be tuned during the adaptive phases of the MCMC algorithm. "prob_mbr"
specifies the probability of the MBR step (default = TRUE). We strongly
recommend to use the default setting (for further details on how this argument
affects MCMC scheme results, see (Su and Borsuk, 2016)).


Let's check the outputs of `BN_module` function:
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

data("BN_mod_res")
getSlots(class(BN_mod_res))

```

1. `BN_mod_res@estimated_beta` numeric, estimated value of hyperparameter $\beta$

2. `BN_mod_res@estimated_len` Numeric, estimated width of the sampling interval 
for hyperparameter $\beta$

3. `BN_mod_res@B_prior_mat_weighted` Empirical biological knowledge matrix,
interactions from the biological prior knowledge and TFs-target interactions 
are constant (unless if "TFBS_belief" is not equal to "woPKGE_belief").

4. `BN_mod_res@CPDAGs_sim1` List of CPDAGs from the first independent MCMC 
simulation (thinned DAGs from the MCMC simulation converted into CPDAGs, 
ducplicated CPDAGs discarded)

5. `BN_mod_res@CPDAGs_sim2` List of CPDAGs from the second independent MCMC 
simulation (thinned DAGs from the MCMC simulation converted into CPDAGs, 
ducplicated CPDAGs discarded)

6. `BN_mod_res@beta_tuning` Matrix of results from adaptive phases that contains
hyperparameter $\beta$ tuning (trace of hyperparameter $\beta$, trace of width 
of the sampling interval for hyperparameter $\beta$

7. `BN_mod_res@rms` Numeric, trace of root mean square used for c_rms measure 
to evaluate the convergence of MCMC simulation


### Part 4: MCMC diagnostics

Trace plots provide an important tool for assessing mixing of a Markov chain and  
should be inspected carefully. We can generate them using the `trace_plots` 
functions:  

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

trace_plots(mcmc_res = BN_mod_res,
            burn_in = 10000,
            thin = 500, 
            edge_freq_thres = 0.5)


```

The `trace_plots` function generates:
  
1. trace plot of beta values (we want to explore the sample space many times and 
avoid flat bits - the chain stays in the same state for too long; in this case, 
beta value fluctuates around single value, so the Markov chain is mixing well).  

2. consistency of edges posterior probabilities in two independent MCMC 
simulations (scatter plot of the edge weights confidence using two independent 
MCMC runs; the convergence is determined by the spread of the points around 
the y=x line; in this case, the edge weights seems to be consistent in two 
independent simulations).

3. the c<sub>rms</sub> strength for the convergence evaluation (summarizes 
the spread of the points around the line y=x, for details see 
(Agostinho et al., 2015) and (Pacinkova \& Popovici, 2022)).

The parameter "edge_freq_thres" determines the quantile of all edge weights
used to filter only reliable edges (default = NULL, all edges will be considered
as present). For illustration, we use quite low edge weights filter to capture
interactions between features from different layers. We recommend to use some
edge weights filtering, such as 0.75 quantile of all edge weights
in the resulting networks using "edge_freq_thres = 0.75".


Now we use `edge_weights` and `weighted_net` functions to define the resulting
regulatory network inferred by `r Biocpkg("IntOMICS")` with specific thresholds:
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

res_weighted <- edge_weights(mcmc_res = BN_mod_res, 
                            burn_in = 10000, 
                            thin = 500, 
                            edge_freq_thres = 0.5)

weighted_net_res <- weighted_net(cpdag_weights = res_weighted,
                                 gene_annot = gene_annot, 
                                 PK = PK, 
                                 OMICS_mod_res = OMICS_mod_res, 
                                 gene_ID = "gene_symbol", 
                                 TFtargs = TFtarg_mat, 
                                 B_prior_mat_weighted = BN_mod_res@B_prior_mat_weighted)

```
The parameter "gene_ID" determines the IDs used in the final network. There are
two options: "gene_symbol" (default) or "entrezID".


### Part 5: IntOMICS resulting network structure

We can plot the resulting regulatory network inferred by `r Biocpkg("IntOMICS")` 
using `ggraph_weighted_net` function (node size and label size can be modified):

```{r fig_weights, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}

ggraph_weighted_net(net = weighted_net_res, 
                    node_size = 10, 
                    node_label_size = 4, 
                    edge_label_size = 4)

```

Edges highlighted in blue are known from the biological prior knowledge.
The edge labels reflects its empirical frequency over the final set of CPDAGs.
GE node names are in upper case, CNV node names are in lower case, METH node
names are the same as DNA methylation probe names in `omics$meth` matrix.
Node colour scales are given by GE/CNV/METH values of all features
from the corresponding input data matrix.


We can also change the edge labels to inspect the empirical prior knowledge
inferred by `r Biocpkg("IntOMICS")` using the argument "edge_weights = empB"
(default = "MCMC_freq"):
```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

res_weighted <- edge_weights(mcmc_res = BN_mod_res, 
                            burn_in = 10000, 
                            thin = 500, 
                            edge_freq_thres = 0.5)

weighted_net_res <- weighted_net(cpdag_weights = res_weighted,
                                 gene_annot = gene_annot, 
                                 PK = PK, 
                                 OMICS_mod_res = OMICS_mod_res, 
                                 gene_ID = "gene_symbol", 
                                 edge_weights = "empB",
                                 TFtargs = TFtarg_mat, 
                                 B_prior_mat_weighted = BN_mod_res@B_prior_mat_weighted)

```


```{r fig_empB, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}

ggraph_weighted_net(net = weighted_net_res)

```



Function `empB_heatmap` can be used to check the difference between empirical
biological knowledge and biological prior knowledge in GE-GE interactions:
```{r fig_heat, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}

emp_b_heatmap(mcmc_res = BN_mod_res, 
             OMICS_mod_res = OMICS_mod_res, 
             gene_annot = gene_annot, 
             TFtargs = TFtarg_mat)

```
Interactions with constant biological knowledge are highlighted in gray.

Interesting could be also density of the edge weights inferred by `r Biocpkg("IntOMICS")`. 
First of all, we have to use the `edge_weights` function without the edge weights
filtering:
```{r fig_ew, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 5}

res_weighted <- edge_weights(mcmc_res = BN_mod_res, 
                            burn_in = 10000, 
                            thin = 500,
                            edge_freq_thres = NULL)
                            
weighted_net_res <- weighted_net(cpdag_weights = res_weighted,
                                 gene_annot = gene_annot, 
                                 PK = PK, 
                                 OMICS_mod_res = OMICS_mod_res, 
                                 gene_ID = "gene_symbol", 
                                 TFtargs = TFtarg_mat, 
                                 B_prior_mat_weighted = BN_mod_res@B_prior_mat_weighted)

dens_edge_weights(weighted_net_res)

```
